### What is GENEA Leaderboard?

**GENEA** (**G**eneration and **E**valuation of **N**on-verbal Behaviour for **E**mbodied **A**gents) Leaderboard is a leaderboard for benchmarking gesture generation models with human evaluation.
The GENEA Leaderboard is the evolution of the GENEA challenge, which was held at the GENEA Workshop at ICMI 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
{/* Generation and Evaluation of Non-verbal Behaviour for Embodied Agents */}

### Why we need GENEA Leaderboard?

We standardize the input, output and evaluation process of gesture generation models with human evaluation.

### How we evalution GENEA Leaderboard?

We provide a input to teams, and each team's model will generate gestures output in `.npy` format.

<GeneaLeaderboard style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} />

Then, we convert `.npy` to video `.mp4` and recruit Prolific to start user studies.
Using pairwise comparison, we evaluate the generated gestures with human evaluation

<EvaluationProcess style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} />

## Announcement

- The GENEA team is preparing an **online leaderboard** for benchmarking
  gesture generation models with human evaluation. This project is the evolution
  of the GENEA challenge, so stay tuned!
